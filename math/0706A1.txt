Q3.
 Proof of existence using mathematical induction
 When case A1 is True and assuming case An is True, if case An+1 is True, An must be True for all n.
 Case A1 >>
  x ∈ (0, 1]
  x = n - 𝜀
  x = 1 - 𝜀
  𝜀 = 1 - x
  It is True that there exist n and 𝜀 that satisfy x = 1 - 𝜀 when x is a real number greater than 0 and equal to or less than 1.
 Case An >>
  x ∈ (n - 1, n]
  Assume x = n - 𝜀
  Assume it True that there exist n and 𝜀 that satisfy x = n - 𝜀 when x is a real number greater than n - 1 and equal to or less than n.
 Case An+1 >>
  x ∈ (n, n + 1]
  x - 1 ∈ (n - 1, n]
  x - 1 = y = n - 𝜀
  x - 1 = n - 𝜀
  x = (n + 1) - 𝜀
  It is True that there exist n and 𝜀 that satisfy x = n + 1 - 𝜀 when x is a real number greater than n and equal or less than n + 1.
 Thus, Case-An is also True.
 Then there exist n and 𝜀 that satisfy x = n - 𝜀 for all real number x.

 Uniqueness proof by contradiction
 Say that n and 𝜀 are not unique in x = n - 𝜀.
 Suppose there are two sets of n and 𝜀 that satisfy x = n - 𝜀.
 The first set is n1 and 𝜀1, and the second set is n2 and 𝜀2.
 Assume n1 ≠ n2 and 𝜀1 ≠ 𝜀2
 Then, n1 - 𝜀1 = x = n2 - 𝜀2.
 Thus, n1 - 𝜀1 = n2 - 𝜀2
 If so, n1 - n2 = 𝜀1 - 𝜀2.
 However, this is false because |n1 - n2| ≥ 1 and |𝜀1 - 𝜀2| < 1, since n is an integer and 0 ≤ 𝜀 < 1.
 By proof by contradiction, it is true that there exist unique numbers n and 𝜀 that x = n - 𝜀 where n is an integer, and 0 ≤ 𝜀 < 1, given a real number x.

 2^(n+1)/2 if n is odd.
 Or simply, 2^⌈n/2⌉

Q6.
 Proof by contradiction
 Say that the i-th box can contain up to ni - 1 objects.
 Then, there would be (n1 - 1) + (n2 - 1) + ··· + (nt - 1) objects for all t boxes.
 That is, n1 + n2 + ··· + nt - t objects.
 However, the given number of objects is n1 + n2 + ··· + nt - t + 1.
 By the pigeonhole principle, there needs to be a box that would accept one more object to place all objects in the boxes.
 At least one i-th box must have (ni - 1) + 1 objects; thus, ni objects.
 By proof by contradiction, it is true that there is one or more boxes that keep at least ni objects when there are t boxes and n1 + n2 + ··· + nt - t + 1 objects to place in.
