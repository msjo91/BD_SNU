## OOP: Terminology
### Class
User-defined blueprint or a mold of an object that defines attributes (data members and methods)
#### Data member
A class or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.
##### Class variable
A variable that is shared by all instances of a class.  
A class variable is defined within the class but outside of any methods.
##### Instance variable
A variable that is defined within a method and only belongs to the current instance.
#### Method
A function within a class.
### Object
A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class.

```
obj = MyClass()
```
`obj` is an object.
### Instance
An individual object of a class.

```
obj = MyClass()
```
`obj` is an instance of `MyClass`.
## Note
The only difference between object and instance is relational expression?  
This does not seem right.  
There must be more.
